TODO here:

- INTRO
- Headings

Having a clear introductory paragraph that outlines what the project does in two or three sentences, including what platforms it runs on, and what Swift version it’s written in.
Stating any prerequisites that are required, especially any third-party tools that someone may not have installed, or any third-party frameworks that your code uses. After reading this, users should be able to build and run your code.
Explaining any important choices, such as whether you’ve made unusual architectural choices, how thorough your tests are, how accessible the project is, etc.
How others can contribute to the project, if you want this. For example, you might request that they make sure all your tests pass and that SwiftLint isn’t flagging up any errors, or you might have a code of conduct for all contributors.
Stating what license you’re releasing your code under. As far as I’m concerned, all the code from any book or course that I write is free for you to use however you want, so license it under anything you choose – MIT is very common, but you might also consider not using an open-source license at all.
Adding any acknowledgements for folks that have helped you along the way.
